// Notes
* I don't know how to make strings in Stata, so comments will do for now

// Project language file 1
* For: seanpm2001/Learn-Stata
* About:
* I decided to make Stata the main project language file for this project (Seanpm2001/Learn-Stata) as Stata is the language this project is dedicated to, because this project is about learning the Stata programming language. It only makes sense to make Stata the official language for this project. It is getting its own project language file, starting here.
